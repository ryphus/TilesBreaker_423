This is the repository of our project for CSE423 which is a Tiles Breaker Game. Tiles Breaker 3D.py is the main project file.
  

Core Gameplay

The game is a classic brick-breaker where the player controls a paddle or slider at the bottom of the screen, moving it left and right to bounce a ball toward bricks at the top. The ball rebounds off the paddle and walls, aiming to break the tiles, and missing the ball costs a life. Bricks come in three types: standard bricks that break with one hit, strong bricks that require 2â€“3 hits, and unbreakable bricks that act as permanent obstacles. Randomly assigned power-ups drop from destroyed bricks as collectible droplets, activating effects such as expanding or shrinking the paddle, splitting the ball into multiple balls, slowing or speeding up the ball, or granting extra lives, adding strategic variety to gameplay. The game features 10 increasingly challenging levels, each with unique brick layouts, dynamic randomness of 5% to keep patterns unpredictable, and additional level-specific rules to maintain difficulty. Ball speed ramps up progressively, creating an escalating challenge as players advance. A score system rewards players for breaking bricks, with bonus points for hitting streaks or completing levels quickly. Controls are intuitive, using either the W/S keys or the left/right arrow keys for smooth paddle movement, while the graphics remain simple, flat, and colorful, emphasizing clarity and fast-paced, engaging gameplay. Players must balance skill and strategy, collecting power-ups, anticipating ball trajectories, and managing multiple balls or faster speeds to successfully clear all bricks and advance through the levels. The combination of progressive difficulty, varied brick types, and interactive power-ups ensures a dynamic and replayable experience, suitable for both casual play and competitive scoring.

Features distribution:
Paddle/Slider Control
 The paddle moves left and right at the bottom of the screen. Its movement must be smooth and responsive, ensuring reliable ball interaction and precise positioning for collecting power-ups.


Bouncing Ball Mechanics
 The ball bounces off walls, bricks, and the paddle, following realistic trajectories. Collisions and angle calculations are handled so that gameplay feels dynamic and fair, with increasing challenge as levels progress.


Standard and Strong Bricks
 Bricks come in multiple types: standard bricks break with one hit, while strong bricks take multiple hits. Each type contributes differently to scoring and requires distinct strategies to clear efficiently.


Unbreakable Bricks
 Permanent obstacles that only bounce the ball back. Their placement affects ball trajectories and adds complexity to level design, requiring careful shot planning.


Lives System
 Missing the ball costs a life. Losing all lives triggers game over. This feature ensures tension and stakes in gameplay, encouraging precision and careful planning.


Expand/Shrink Paddle Power-Ups
 Certain bricks drop power-ups that adjust the paddle size. Expanded paddles make catching the ball easier, while shrunken paddles increase difficulty, adding variability to gameplay.


Ball Speed Power-Ups
 Bricks can release power-ups that modify ball speed. Slowing the ball makes control easier, while speeding it up increases challenge and excitement, introducing dynamic pacing.


Multi-Ball Power-Up
 Activating this power-up splits the ball into multiple balls simultaneously. This adds both scoring potential and complexity, requiring careful attention and coordination to keep all balls in play.


Level Progression and Difficulty
 The game includes 10 progressively challenging levels, each with unique layouts, brick patterns, and obstacles. Dynamic elements and slight random variations (around 5%) ensure that each level feels fresh and challenging.


Score System and Streak Bonuses
 Points are awarded for breaking bricks, with stronger bricks giving higher rewards. Consecutive hits or streaks provide bonus points, rewarding precision, planning, and skillful play.
